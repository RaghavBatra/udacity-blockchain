## Introduction to the project
This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a _seller_ and _buyer_. In this example, we trace the supply chain of coffee beans, which reach the buyer(consumer) from the seller(farmer). The farmer harvests, processes, packs and sells the beans, which are bought by a distributor, who then ships these to a retailer. Finally after being received by the retailer, a consumer purchases the beans from this retailer.
